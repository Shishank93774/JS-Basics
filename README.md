# My Learning JS Repo

This repository is a personal learning space where I am exploring and practicing JavaScript. I am using this repository to experiment with different concepts, work on coding exercises, and build small projects to improve my JavaScript skills.

Feel free to browse through the code and projects in this repository. Keep in mind that since this is a learning repository, the code might not be perfect, but it reflects my progress and growth as I learn JavaScript.

Happy learning!
